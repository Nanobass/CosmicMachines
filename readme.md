# Cosmic Machines
A Quilt Mod that adds lots of stuff needed for a nice experience such as Inventory and 
Energy Systems, brand new (ugly) UI, "survival" and "creative" mode, but also lots of internal
changes such as ticked blocks, item inventories and renderers, crafting and block menus.
The core of this Mod is Machines. It includes Generator, Factories, Furnaces, Crafting,
Batteries and everything known from popular Minecraft Mods,
# Warning
This mod is a highly unstable beta running on an unreleased version 
of FluxAPI 6.0 (will be available on release), FluxAPI 6.0 is not stable / tested yet and can corrupt / break worlds
# Planned Features
- Experimental Crafting System: similar to Satisfactory, but with OreDict and so on
- Furnace, Grinder, Washer, Assembler as some Basic Machines to get going
- Boilers, Pumps, Tanks, Pipes and *Steam* for some Generator variety
- ***Explosions***
- Rocket Fuel
# Contributing
Any Help would be appreciated, especially in cleaning up Mixins and saving / loading
Cable Networks and Machine Connections.
Textures and Block Models are always welcome, in the future Block Meshes will also be possible (using FluxAPI 6.0).
Recipe suggestions and new machine ideas are appreciated
# Plugins
Right now it's difficult to register stuff cleanly, there will be a Plugin Interface
